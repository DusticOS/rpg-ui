Tabletop Roleplaying Game comapion app

RPGUI will be an app to be used during the playing of a Tabletop Roleplaying Game like Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder.
It is designed for use at the table during play as a way for all players to keep track of information pertaining to both
their own, as well as eachother's characters.  RPGUI will display information such as:
-Hit Points
-Conditions
-Spells/Abilities
-Armor Class/Saves
-Initiative

This information will be displayed about each player at the table and potentially viewable by all other players and the GM.
In order to use RPGUI, a GM will open a session with any prepared content, and players will be able to join their session with 
their prepared characters.  Any changes made to character data will be publicly displayed for all palyers in the session.  
e.g. Damage taken, initiative order, conditions applied to characters.

One very important aspect of RPGUI we want to keep in mind is to make it as generic as possible, so that it can be used by players
for whatever game or system they intend to play.  The intent will be to develop templates for particular systems that can, but do not
have to be, applied to a session or character to format their data appropriately, but if a template is not available, RPGUI can still
function with generic data.
